# Claymore

### Web Framework
We've decided to use <b>Express</b> as our web framework, for these reasons:

* Learning curve and developers’ previous experience
* Community support and overall industry use/adaptation
* Integration with other third party libraries and API’s
* Simplicity and ease of use


### QA/Helpful Tools We Have Set up 

* <b>Eslint</b> is the linter our group uses. We use it to automatically lint our code through the eslint plugin for vscode.

* <b>npm-check</b> is the tool we use for detecting dependency updates. As it is meant to be installed globally through npm, we didn't include it in package.json
